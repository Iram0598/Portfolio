        <p class="sixth"><b> I was born in Kishoreganj and  but grew up in Dhaka,Cantonment.<br> I completed school and college from Safiuddin sarker academy.

                The most satisfying carrer for me is to see myself in a position where I had always wanted to be. 
             I am that kind of person who is always eager to learn to be taught.

                I am seeking a company where I can use my experience 
                and education to help the company meet and surpass its goals.

                Todays job market needs a highly qualified person to be in the race of competition. 
                Most of all, I like to have challenge. 
                As a database designer, I am ready to accept any kind of challenge in any time.
                
                As a engineer, my first priority is to help people in need. To upgrade
                 the society and to achieve the objectives of any company 
                 with Honesty and Pride.
